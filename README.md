# Gianatiempo Starter

## Contents

The following tools, categorized by purpose, are included in this starter:

1. [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) + [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) + [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

   Vite offers fast and straightforward performance, Vitest provides rapid testing, and Typescript facilitates JavaScript's scalability. These features provide a solid foundation to begin any project.

2. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) + [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)

   Prettier provides a highly opinionated code formatter, while Eslint functions as a pattern analyzer to ensure code consistency. These tools allow for easy, fast, and automatic typechecking.

3. [React Router Dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) + [MSW](https://mswjs.io/) + [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)

   React router serves as the de-facto router, now equipped with support for loaders, actions, and other features from [Remix](https://remix.run/). MSW simplifies mocking for testing and development, and TanStack Query offers a caching system to enhance performance.

4. [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)

   Ant Design is both a design system and a component library (as opposed to Material Design from Google and MUI from an external source), providing a vast collection of components and examples to accelerate daily activities. This choice is never a bad decision when striving to accomplish excellent results with ease.
